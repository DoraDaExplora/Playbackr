# This app is actually deprecated.

This was a fun project to work on, but I've made too many mistakes while developing it. It makes the codebase really hard to work with.

So I've decided to stop working on this project.
A rework is probably coming when I have free time. 

However, the main use case for this app appears to make zero sense for me, since people can simply stream their Spotify player in fullscreen mode.
